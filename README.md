## Motivation
### In the dataset, there were various columns relating to a car's attributes, and one realistic need for this dataset could be to try to figure out a vehicle's future value using the value of all the other features. Thus, this machine learning project set out to see if this dataset contained any modellable relations. In addition to this, I wanted to tackle a dataset that had a considerable amount of missing data and categorical information as to encounter the need for data cleaning and preparing.
